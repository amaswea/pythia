About Pythia
------------

Pythia is a website for viewing interactive course grade distribution and statistics. It is built with Python, Django framework backend, 
and the visuals are customized from a Bootstrap template (http://getbootstrap.com/). The visualizations use D3 (https://d3js.org/). 

Pythia was built for CSE 510 Human Computer Interaction class at the University of Washington with Rob Thompson, Amanda Swearngin, and Isaac Tian.
